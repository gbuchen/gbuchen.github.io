      <description>Grace Buchen, gb23396  Data Wrangling and Data Exploration Finding data: library(AER) data(&amp;quot;USSeatBelts&amp;quot;) library(readr) Consumption_Alcohol &amp;lt;- read_csv(&amp;quot;Consumption_Alcohol.csv&amp;quot;, col_types = cols(Beer = col_number(), Wine = col_number(), Spirits = col_number(), `All beverages` = col_number())) library(tidyverse) library(dplyr) When starting this project, I wanted to choose a topic that was important to me. In exploring the datasets in R, I found the USSeatBelts dataset. This dataset looks at traffic fatalities and seat belt usage for the years 1983â€“1997 for states in the U.</description>

      <description>Grace Buchen, gb23396  Modeling Finding data: library(AER) data(&amp;quot;NMES1988&amp;quot;) library(tidyverse) library(dplyr) medical &amp;lt;- NMES1988 %&amp;gt;% slice(1:2000) Due to the size of the original dataset, I decided to cut down the number of observations from 4406 to 2000 in order to more easily explore the data. For this project, I chose to use the NMES1988 dataset as it deals with health data for individuals 66 years and older which is a topic that is very interesting to me as I want to work in health care.</description>
